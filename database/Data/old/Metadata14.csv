GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.","World Bank, Development Research Group.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.","EM-DAT: The OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database: www.emdat.be, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels (Belgium), World Bank.",World Bank (WDI),raw,,,,EN.CLC.MDAT.ZS,,natural disasters

MUV,Manufactures Unit Value (MUV) (index),MUV,,index,"The MUV is a composite index of prices for manufactured exports from the fifteen major developed and emerging economies to low- and middle-income economies, valued in U.S. dollars. For the MUV (15) index, unit value indexes in local currency for each country are converted to U.S. dollars using market exchange rates and are combined using weights determined by the share of each country's exports in G15 exports to low- and middle-income countries. The shares are calculated using SITC revision 3 Manufactures exports data from UN COMTRADE in 2005, the base year. The primary manufacturing prices index source is OECD's Domestic Producer Price Index (PPI) for manufacturing. Whenever PPI is not available, export price indexes or the export unit values are used as proxies. The countries and relative weights (in parentheses) are: Brazil (2.95%), Canada (0.93%), China (11.79%), France (5.87%), Germany (13.29%), India (1.77%), Italy (6.07%), Japan (16.70%), Mexico (0.93%), South Africa (0.75%), South Korea (10.95%), Spain (2.30%), Thailand (2.51%), United Kingdom (3.50%), and United States (19.68%).","World Bank, Development Prospects Group; Historical US GDP deflator: US Department of Commerce.",World Bank,raw,,,,,,

Soil quality is defined according to the soil functions (e.g. bearing function, production function, habitat function, resources function, reactor function) and cannot be measured by a single parameter. However, soil organic carbon has been defined by EUROSTAT as the more appropriate indicator for soil quality. High organic carbon content corresponds to good conditions from an agro-environmental point of view. Soils with organic carbon content less than 1% in weight are generally affected by soil degradation processes and erosion. On the other hand, soils with 1-10% organic carbon content have high agricultural value. ",FAO,"FAO, Statistics Division (FAOSTAT)",raw,ES,7221,6709,,,

AG.TFP.AG.GR1,Growth in total factor productivity in agriculture (percent),Growth in total factor productivity in agriculture,,percent,"A simple methodology to assess TFP is to adopt a Solow approach, which involves computing TFP growth as the difference between output growth and input growth, as follows: (TFP*/TFP) ?=(Y*/Y) ?-(X*/X) ?=dlogY/dt-?i(dlogX_i/dt). Instead, we estimate TFP by using a Cobb-Douglas specification Y=AK^? L^? where: Y is real output; A is a scalar; L is a measure of the flow of labor input; K is a measure of the flow of capital input. The parameters ? and ? will indicate if the production function operates in constant, decreasing or increasing returns to scale. By assuming a Cobb-Douglas production function, TFP can be derived as follows (McCloskey, 1972): TFP=A=Y/(K^? L^?). By transforming the above equation into log linear form, the parameters can be estimated by simple least squares. In particular, the above equation is linearized as follows: In Y = In A + ? In K + ? In L . Cobb-Douglas type production function equations are appropriate for the functional analysis intended for the agricultural activities (McCloskey, 1972; Fleisher and Yunhua, 1992). In addition, it is preferred since it provides easy calculation, ability to test production flexibilities statistically and to obtain sufficient number of degree of freedom even where data is very few etc. The model used in this study is given in Eq. 5, which is the revised form of conventional Cobb-Douglas production function in order to estimate TFP. In our dataset, output is Agricultural Gross Production Value (constant 2004-2006 million US$) (USD), inputs are divided in three sub-categories: (1) Total economically active population in Agriculture ; (2) Permanent meadows and pastures; Arable Land; Permanent Crops (3) Livestock: Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, Poultry. TFP has been estimated at Country-level.  All data source have been extracted from FAOSTAT databank. [References: Fleisher, B.M. and L. Yunhua, 1992.

In an emergency situation, the weight and height of children between 6 and 59 months are measured and the results are used as a proxy indicator for the general health of the entire population. The index of weight for height, which eflects recent weight loss or gain, is the best indicator for acute malnutrition. Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) is calculated with the Z-score defined as a weight-for-height index less than -2 standard deviations from the mean weight of a reference population of children of the same height and/or having oedema. Global Acute Malnutrition as calculated with the Median (%M) is defined as all children falling under 80% of the median in the index of weight-for-height median, and/or having Oedema, as compared to the median weight of children of the same height in the reference population. Different GAM thresholds exist that can be used to categorize emergency situations. However, a GAM value of more than 10% generally identifies an emergency. Commonly used threholds for GAM are: <5% = acceptable; 5% to 9.9% = poor; 10% to 14.9% = serious; and  >15% = critical.
