Dear Amy,

A draft text for the energy section is being reviewed by Francesco.

Some specific comments from my side on the spreads are:
- On water, there is a small typo in the table 7 description.
- “Freshwater resources” (table 7 and chart 65) are “Renewable water resources” ? I think they should
- On energy, I see that you preferred to use FAOSTAT data for chart 66. Then can’t we add also 2013 data to the same chart so that people see the increase? Chart 66 should read ”Wood pellets production”
- I see that the plots here are different from what we discussed the other day. Why?  Anyway chart 69 should be “Global biofuel production” (there is a typo in the word biodiesel). There is something wrong with chart 69, where does it come from?
- What do charts 67 and 68 refer to?
- Figure 18 is outdated but we can update it
- There is also something strange in figure 18. Is it really a percentage? Then the legend should be adjusted…
- Is it possible to add fibreboard to chart 70?
- Chart 74: there should be 2012 data available
- What is chart 75? Total agriculture GHG emissions? Maybe better to change the units of all GHG charts to improve readability
- What is Figure 20 exactly? Agriculture GHG?
- The reference year is missing in Chart 77
