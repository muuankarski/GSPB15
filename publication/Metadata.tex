\begin{metadata}{ Agricultural area organic (ha) }{ RL.AREA.AGRORG.HA.NO }
Sum of areas under "Agricultural area certified organic" and "Agricultural area in conversion to organic". Agricultural area certified organic is the land area exclusively dedicated to organic agriculture and managed by applying organic agriculture methods. It refers to the land area fully converted to organic agriculture. It is the portion of land area (including arable lands, pastures or wild areas) managed (cultivated) or wild harvested in accordance with specific organic standards or technical regulations and that has been inspected and approved by a certification body. Agricultural area in conversion to organic is the land area which is going through the organic conversion process, usually two years period of conversion to organic land.

\begin{metadata}{ Average Dietary energy (available for) consumption  }{ HS.PCS.RDEC.KCD }
Measures the amount of calories consumed by the household. It is expressed in kilocalories per person per day. The dietary energy consumption is estimated from the food quantities collected in the survey. Food quantities that are collected "as purchased" (including bones, peels, etc.) first are transformed into edible quantities by taking into consideration the respective food item refuse factor and then are expressed in grams. Once all edible quantities are transformed into grams of nutrients, the nutrient densities (grams of nutrient per gram of food product) of each food item are  used to estimate the amount of calories consumed. The dietary energy consumption should be within reasonable ranges from 800 to 4,000 kcal (whichever decile), and it tends to increase as income increases (although it is also possible that better-off households purchase more expensive and less energetic food). Data are provided by gender (female and male headed households) and by area (urban and rural).

\begin{metadata}{ Average Dietary Energy Supply Adequacy }{ AV3YADESA.DISS }
The Dietary Energy Supply (DES) as a percentage of the Average Dietary Energy Requirement (ADER) in each country. Each country's or region's average supply of calories for food consumption is normalized by the average dietary energy requirement estimated for its population, to provide an index of adequacy of the food supply in terms of calories. Analyzed together with the prevalence of undernourishment, it allows discerning whether undernourishment is mainly due to insufficiency of the food supply or to particularly bad distribution.

\begin{metadata}{ Manufactures Unit Value (MUV) (index) }{ MUV }
The MUV is a composite index of prices for manufactured exports from the fifteen major developed and emerging economies to low- and middle-income economies, valued in U.S. dollars. For the MUV (15) index, unit value indexes in local currency for each country are converted to U.S. dollars using market exchange rates and are combined using weights determined by the share of each country's exports in G15 exports to low- and middle-income countries. The shares are calculated using SITC revision 3 Manufactures exports data from UN COMTRADE in 2005, the base year. The primary manufacturing prices index source is OECD's Domestic Producer Price Index (PPI) for manufacturing. Whenever PPI is not available, export price indexes or the export unit values are used as proxies. The countries and relative weights (in parentheses) are: Brazil (2.95\%), Canada (0.93\%), China (11.79\%), France (5.87\%), Germany (13.29\%), India (1.77\%), Italy (6.07\%), Japan (16.70\%), Mexico (0.93\%), South Africa (0.75\%), South Korea (10.95\%), Spain (2.30\%), Thailand (2.51\%), United Kingdom (3.50\%), and United States (19.68\%).

\begin{metadata}{ Protein, fat, and carbohydrates contribution to Dietary Energy Consumption }{ HS.NCDEC.RPRT.PCT }
Proportion of dietary energy provided by each macronutrient. The proportion of calories from protein and fats are estimated as their respective consumption in grams times 4 and 9, respectively. Then the calories from total carbohydrates and alcohol are estimated as the difference between total dietary energy consumption and the calories coming from protein and fats. The concept of a balanced diet is applied in more than one of the ADePT-FSM output tables. A joint WHO/FAO group of experts established guidelines for a "balanced diet", described in terms of the proportions of total dietary energy provided by diverse sources of energy (WHO 2003). These guidelines are related to the effects of chronic non deficiency diseases. So, according to the experts, a diet is determined to be balanced when: a) The proportion of dietary energy provided by protein is in the range of 10-15 percent; b) The proportion of dietary energy provided by fats is in the range of 15-30 percent; c) The proportion of total dietary energy provided by the remaining macronutrients is in the range of 55-75 percent.

This is mainly because richer households can afford more expensive food products such as meat and fish. However, such a trend probably is not present in pastoral regions where poor communities/households derive a sizeable part of their consumption from livestock products (i.e., milk and cheese).
