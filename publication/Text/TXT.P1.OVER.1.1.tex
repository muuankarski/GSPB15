Undernourishment refers to food intake that is insufficient to meet dietary energy requirements for an active and healthy life. About 805 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished in 2012â€“14. This number has fallen by 100 million over the last decade, and by 209 million since 1990-92. Despite progress, the number is still high, and marked differences across regions persist. Latin America and the Caribbean have made the greatest overall progress, with modest progress in sub-Saharan Africa and Western Asia, which have been afflicted by natural disasters and conflict.
